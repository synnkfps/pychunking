### pychunking
prototypes of python chunk-ing (write and read big lists faster)

### 1st prototype mechanic
its simple, create an list normally, then to iterate it appends the elements of the list with a counter, if the counter is 10, clear the list and continue appending, i enjoyed it because it works as i wanted to, its also extremly fast!
